import requests
import json
import datetime as dt
import os

STOCK = "TSLA"
COMPANY_NAME = "Tesla"

## STEP 1: Use https://www.alphavantage.co to gather data for yesterday and day before.

#parameters for stock API
stock_parameters = {
    "function": "TIME_SERIES_DAILY",
    "symbol": STOCK,
    "outputsize": "compact",
    "apikey": os.environ["API_ALPHAVANTAGE"]
}

stock_response = requests.get('https://www.alphavantage.co/query', params=stock_parameters)
stock_response.raise_for_status

#write data to json for analysis
with open("stock_data.json", "w") as json_file:
     json.dump(stock_response.json(), json_file)

#calculate the date for yesterday and day before yesterday
yesterday = dt.date.today() - dt.timedelta(days = 1)
before_yesterday = dt.date.today() - dt.timedelta(days = 2)

#getting the closing prices for each day we need
yesterday_closing_price = float(stock_response.json()['Time Series (Daily)'][str(yesterday)]["4. close"])
before_yesterday_closing_price = float(stock_response.json()['Time Series (Daily)'][str(before_yesterday)]["4. close"])

#calculate the price difference between the days as percentage, up to the 2 decimals
price_diff = round(((yesterday_closing_price/before_yesterday_closing_price)*100),2)

## STEP 2: Use https://newsapi.org get the first 3 news pieces for the COMPANY_NAME
# if the price difference is higher than 4.

news_parameters = {
    'apiKey': os.environ["API_NEWS"],
    "q": (COMPANY_NAME, STOCK)
}

news_response = requests.get("https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines", params=news_parameters)
news_response.raise_for_status

with open("news_data.json", "w") as json_file:
     json.dump(news_response.json(), json_file)

top_news = news_response.json()["articles"][:3]

if abs(100-price_diff) >=4:
    for news in top_news:
        title = news["title"]
        source_name = news["source"]["name"]
        print(f"{source_name}: {title}")


## STEP 3: Use https://www.twilio.com
# Send a seperate message with the percentage change and each article's title and description to your phone number.


#Optional: Format the SMS message like this:
